# TaxKit API

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- Renamed API runtime configuration to the `TAXKIT_` environment prefix and
  the local development endpoint to `https://api.taxkit.localhost` as part of
  the TaxKit identity cutover. Public HTTP route paths, request schemas and
  response schemas are unchanged.

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Added `POST /api/v1/calculators/:calculatorId/calculate` for public
  calculator execution across take-home pay, PAYG withholdings and annual
  income tax, with schema-guided fact decode errors.
- Added public calculator metadata routes for jurisdictions, tax years,
  calculator discovery, calculator schema metadata, graph diagnostics, facts
  and rules.
- Added the standalone Bun API runtime for the public TaxKit HTTP surface.
- Added public API documentation routes for the initial health-check contract:
  `GET /api/docs` and `GET /api/docs/openapi.json`.
- Added `GET /api/health` as the initial API availability endpoint.
